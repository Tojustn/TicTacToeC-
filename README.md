# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This project implements a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **C++**. The game allows two players to play against each other in a 3x3 grid, following the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an interactive console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that is simple yet fun to play. The game is entirely text-based and supports player-vs-player mode. 

### Key Features:
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Two players take turns marking `X` or `O` on a 3x3 grid.
- **Win detection**: The game detects when a player has won (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or if the game is a draw.
- **Input validation**: Ensures valid moves are made by each player.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with `X` or `O`.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all 9 cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
